\section{Splitting Algorithm}
\label{sec:splitting}

\begin{concretesyntax}

The primary strength of \lang\ is the expressive power afforded by
its ability to syntactically interleave work intended for stage \bbone\
and work intended for stage \bbtwo, as well as it ability to form
mixed-stage abstractions.
[Sentence about how we actual want this in separated monostage form.]
In this section, we introduce a {\em splitting transformation} whose job 
is to translate \lang\ terms into a form where the stages are 
seperated {\em at the top level}.

Recall that $\colmix {e_1}{A_1}$ represents multistage computations with multistage results,
whereas $\coltwo {e_2}{A_2}$ represents multistage computions with stage \bbtwo\ results.
Similarly, our splitting algorithm has two forms, 
given by the judgements $\splitonesym$ and $\splittwosym$, 
which respectively take these types of \lang\ terms as input.
For the outputs, we introduce new constructs 
to encode multistage values and computations that are syntactically separated at the top level.

\subsection{Masking}

Recall that partial values (including residual tables) produced by \bbone-evaluation may
contain content at \emph{both} stages. 
In particular, partial values have the character of a value at stage~\bbone\ and of a term at stage~\bbtwo.
For example, the term
\begin{lstlisting}
1`(1+2, next{`2`7 + 5`1`})`
\end{lstlisting}
evaluates via $\redonesym$ to:
\begin{lstlisting}
2`[yhat|->7+5]` 1`(3,next{`2`yhat`1`})`
\end{lstlisting}

What we desire is a simple way to translate this partial value into a form that separates the stage~\bbone\ content (the value \texttt{3}) 
from the stage~\bbtwo\ content (the term $\letin \yhat {\mathtt{7+5}} \yhat$),
allowing us to later define a term translation that respects this value translation.

For this purpose, we define a relation called {\em masking}, written $\vsplito$, 
which sends partial values to {\em masked values}.
Masked values have only one form, written $\mval {i} {r}$, 
where $i$ is a monostage value (the {\em immediate value}) and $r$ is a monostage term (the {\em resumer}).
The masking relation is defined in \ref{fig:valMask}.

Masking operates by first inducting on the entries of the residual table.  
Being purely stage~\bbtwo\ content, these are reified into let statements at the top of the resumer.
Once the table is empty, masking inducts on value itself.

Masking assigns purely stage~\bbone\ values to the immediate value
and likewise assign references into the residual table to the resumer.
In both cases, the offside component is assigned to \texttt{()}, to represent trivial information.

Masking distributes into tuples, injections, and rolls, since their subvalues may have content at both stages.
However, the tags of injections and rolls are replicated only in the immediate value, 
since they represent stage~\bbone\ information.

Since lambdas may represent multi-stage computations, 
masking splits the body of lambdas as a general stage~\bbone\ terms (as described in \ref{sec:split-one}), 
and packages the resulting terms as functions.

The exmaple above is masked into,
\begin{lstlisting}
mv((3,()), let yhat=7+5 in ((),yhat))
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Stage \bbone\ Term Splitting}
\label{sec:split-one}

Splitting a stage~\bbone\ term $e$ in \lang\ yields a term 
$e_1$ that performs all stage~\bbone\ subcomputations in $e$ and a \emph{resumer term} $e_2 = l.r$ that performs all stage~\bbtwo\ subcomputations.
To ensure the results of splitting produce the same output as the evaluation $e\mathbin{\redonesym}[\xi;v]$,
we require that $e_1$ reduce to the tuple $(y,b)$,
where $y$, called the \emph{\bbone-result} of $e$, is identical to $\masko{\xi;v}$, and that
$\letin l b r$ reduces to the same value as $\maskt{\xi;v}$. (We refer to $b$ as the \emph{boundary value} of the split since it carries information between stage~\bbone\ and stage~\bbtwo\ subcomputations.) Since~$e_1$ performs both stage~\bbone\ subcomputations needed to produce the \bbone-result and subcomputations (refered to as \emph{precomputations}) that produce the boundary value, we refer to this term as the \emph{combined term}, and hereafter denote it as~$c$.

The splitting algorithm for stage~\bbone\ terms, as specified by the
judgment $e \splitonesym [c,l.r]$ in \cref{fig:termSplit}, proceeds
recursively on the structure of~$e$.
When $e$ is a terminal (a variable or base constant)
splitting yields a combined term formed by tupling $e$ with a \texttt{()} precomputation, and the trivial resumer \texttt{()}. (Stage~\bbone\ terminals, by definition, contain no stage~\bbtwo\ subcomputations.)  For example, the integer constant \texttt{3} splits into the combined term \texttt{(3,())} and resumer \texttt{\_=>()}.

% Note the direct correspondence of these splitting outputs to the output of the stage~\bbone\ and~\bbtwo\ masking functions.

For all non-terminals (except $\next$),
splitting descends into $e$, recursively splitting its $n$ subterms
to produce their respective combined terms $c_1,\ldots,c_n$ and resumers $r_1, \ldots, r_n$.
The combined term of $e$ is formed by binding $c_1,\ldots,c_n$
to the patterns $(y_1,b_1),\ldots,(y_n,b_n)$
to isolate \bbone-results from boundary values. Then,
the \bbone-result of $e$ is formed by replacing $e$'s subterms with $y_1,\ldots,y_n$.
The resumer binds the boundary values $b_1,\ldots,b_n$ to an
argument $(l_1,\ldots,l_n)$ in a term that has the same structure
of~$e$ but where each subterm is replaced by its resumer ($r_i$'s).

Splitting {\tt case} yields a combined term that executes one of the branches' combined terms based on the \bbone-result $y_1$ of the predicate.
The boundary value $b_i$ for this branch is injected and bundled with that of the predicate ($b_1$).   
$b_i$ is cased in the resumer to determine which branch's resumer should be executed.
{\tt case} and $\pause$ are the only two rules where splitting adds non-trivial logic is added to the precomputation.

Function introduction has a \texttt{()} boundary value,
since functions are already fully reduced in our semantics.
However, since the body of a function may itself be multi-stage, splitting must continue into it.
The \bbone-result is a new function formed from the stage~\bbone\ part of the original body.
The resumer is a new function formed out of the stage~\bbtwo\ part of the original body.
It is the responsibility of the application site to save the precomputation of the function body
and pass it to the resumer version of the function.

Since the results of splitting $\next$ terms depend on the output of splitting its stage~\bbtwo\ subterm,
we defer description of $\next$ until after describing stage~\bbtwo\ term splitting.

\subsection{Stage \bbtwo\ Term Splitting}

Because stage~\bbtwo\ terms in \lang\ fully reduce to values (as opposed to partial values),
splitting stage~\bbtwo\ terms in \lang\ assumes a simpler form than that of stage~\bbone\ term splitting. 
Specifically, splitting a stage~\bbtwo\ term $e$ in \lang\ generates a precomputation term $p$
(performing all stage~\bbone\ subcomputations in $e$) and a
resumer term $e_2=l.r$ (performing all stage~\bbtwo\ subcomputations) such that when 
$e$ reduces to the value~$v$, $\letin l p r$ reduces to an identical value in \langmono.
Note that in contrast to the combined term produced during stage~\bbone\ splitting,
the precomputation $p$ generated by stage~\bbtwo\ splitting exists entirely
to compute the boundary value expected by the resumer.

% \ur{I don't quite understand the following.}
% (Thus, the resumer, bound to the value output by $p$, is equivalent to
% the residual term defined in~\ref{ssec:dynamics})

As with stage~\bbone\ terms, the splitting algorithm for stage~\bbtwo\ terms,
as specified by the judgment $e \splittwosym [p,l.r]$ in \cref{fig:termSplit}, is defined on the local structure of $e$.
In the terminal cases of
constants and variables, splitting generates trivial precomputations that are \texttt{()}, and resumers consisting of the original term.
For example, the integer constant \texttt{3} splits into the
precomputation \texttt{()} and resumer \texttt{\_=>3}.

For all non-terminal terms~$e$ in \lang\ (except $\prev$
and $\pause$)
% recursively splitting
% subterms and generating precomputations $p_1, \ldots, p_n$ and
% resumers $r_1, \ldots, r_n$ for a term with~$n$ immediate subterms.
the precomputation of~$e$ is defined as the combined precomputations of $e$'s $n$ subterms:
$p=(p_1,\ldots,p_n)$.  The resumer binds each boundary value to an
argument $(l_1,\ldots,l_n)$ in a term that has the same structure
of~$e$ but where each subterm is replaced by its corresponding resumer $r_i$.

A notable properly of splitting stage~\bbtwo\ \texttt{case}s and functions is that the
precomputation of subterms is lifted out from underneath stage
\bbtwo\
binders.  % TODO: should probably draw a parallel to the same behavior in dynamics
\ur{This last point seems important.  It would be important to come
  back to it.}

Splitting $\prev$ generates a precomputation that projects the \bbone-result of its stage~\bbone\ subterm.
Since the argument to $\prev$ is of $\fut$ type, its \bbone-result reduces to \texttt{()}, justifying why it can be thrown away.
$\pause$ treats the entire combined term of its stage~\bbone\ subexpression as a precomputation, 
and projects out the integer result in the resumer. 
\footnote{The resumer of an integer expression is usually trivial, 
but we have to include it here for termination purposes.} 
Finally, splitting $\next$ simply tuples up the precomputation of its stage~\bbtwo\ subterm with a trivial \bbone-result \texttt{()}.


\subsection{Improved Definition}
\label{sec:resumers}

The definitions of masking and splitting can be augmented to better handle special cases,
particularly ones that depend on the type of the term we're splitting.
One such special case is the behavior of stage \bbone\ splitting at stage \bbone\ types that contain no $\fut$s or $\to$s.
We call such types {\em monostage} (judgmentally, $A~mono$), 
because a partial value $v$ with a monostage type can contain no $\next$s,
and so must comprise only stage \bbone\ information.

Intuitively, for $[\xi;v] : A$ and $A~mono$, 
we would expect that $\maskt{\xi;v}$ only reduce to something that carries no information.
This indeed happens: for example, $\maskt {\cdot;\mathtt{(inl~3,5)}}$ reduces to \texttt{((),())}.
But while \texttt{((),())} technically ``carries no information," it still has non-trivial structure.
This is not only unintuitive, but potentially expensive.
Instead, we desire a stronger property, that $\maskt{\xi;v}$ only reduce to exactly \texttt{()}. 
We can achieve this by adjusting just the tuple rule:
\[
\maskt{\cdot;(v_1,v_2)} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 
\mathtt{()} &\text{if } (v_1,v_2):A~mono\\ 
(\maskt{\cdot;v_1},\maskt{\cdot;v_2}) &\text{otherwise} \end{array} \right.
\]
From here, the splitting rules can be made to comport with this new 
definition adding special-case tuple, projection, and application 
rules:
\begin{mathpar}
\infer
	{(e_1,e_2):A\times B\splitonesym [\ldots,(l_1,l_2).(r_1;r_2;())]}
	{e_1 : A \splitonesym [c_1,l_1.r_1] 
	& e_2 : B \splitonesym [c_2,l_2.r_2] 
	& A \times B~mono} 
\and
\infer
	{\pio~e:A\splitonesym [\ldots,l.(r;())]}
	{e : A\times B \splitonesym [c,l.r] 
	& A \times B~mono} 
\and
\infer
	{e_1~e_2: B\splitonesym [\ldots,(l_1,l_2,l_3).(r_1 (r_2,l_3); ())]}
	{e_1 : A \to B \splitonesym [c_1,l_1.r_1] 
	& e_2 : A \splitonesym [c_2,l_2.r_2] 
	& B~mono} 
\end{mathpar}
The old tuple, projection, and application rules 
must also be augmented to apply only when the $mono$ premises don't hold.
Also, all splitting rules need to be augmented to carry types, though
we omit the contexts here.
