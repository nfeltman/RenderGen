\title{\Large\textbf{A Generative Representation of Sampling-Based Visibility Algorithms}}

\maketitle

\begin{center}
There has been considerable research activity in the field of sampling-based visibility algorithms for the past 25 years.  To achieve high performance, these algorithms have become very specialized to workloads and hardware domains.  [why is this a problem]. We present a novel representation of the space of sampling-based visibility algorithms using notions of decomposition, bounds formation, bounds testing, and map-reduction as primitives.  We also present a compiler capable of translating our representation to single-core code.
