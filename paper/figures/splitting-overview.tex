**Evaluation:

If  
$e: A @ 1$
then
$e$ $red_1$ residual table, partial value

$red_1$: 1-eval

If 
$e: A @ 2$ 
then
$e$ $red_2$ $q$, where $q$ is a residual in an unstaged language.

$red_2$: 2-eval,  which we think of as being identical to specialization. 

** Splitting

$e:A@1$ splits into $c$, which represents all stage-1 subcomputations
where $c$ reduces $(y,b)$, where $y$ is the 1-result and $b$ is the
boundary value.  

 
** Correctness

$y$ is equal to one-mask of evaluating e with 1-eval.

let l = b in r $red$ $v$ (vanilla reduction), where $v$ is identical
to the reduced value (via $red$) of two-mask of  e with 1-eval.
