\section{Introduction}

Staged computation has existed as a programming technique for over three decades.  Jorring et al. (\cite{jorring86}) identify three classes of staging techniques: meta-programming, partial evaluation, and stage-splitting.  The first two of these have received significantly more attention than the third.

We call these techniques {\em staged} in that part of their input comes in the first stage, and part comes in the second stage.  Likewise, some computation occurs at each stage as well.

Countless meta-programming systems exist (...twelve thousand citations...\cite{devito13}), and their background theory and type-systems are well understood (\cite{davies01}).  Partial evaluation, too, is well-understood.  Partial evaluation systems exist... . This paper explores both theory and applications for stage-splitting.
