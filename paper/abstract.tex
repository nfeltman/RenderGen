Many algorithms can perform useful work before receiving all of their inputs.
If we regard those inputs as arriving at different \emph{stages} of the
computation, then we can \emph{split} those algorithms into, for each stage, a
function performing all the work dependent only on the available inputs.

Prior work on splitting has been limited to simple, imperative languages; in
this paper, we extend splitting to \lang, a typed lambda calculus equipped with
a modal staging operator, allowing us to split recursive and higher-order
functions.

These new features allow us to express some familiar algorithms which, when
split, yield asymptotic improvements; for example, quickselect of the $k$th
smallest element of a list $l$ splits into (1) sorting $l$ into a binary search
tree, then (2) finding the tree's $k$th leftmost element.
